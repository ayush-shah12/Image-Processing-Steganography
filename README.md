# Image-Processing-Steganography
This project involved storing images as quadtree structures and doing various recursive operations on the tree, such as traversals and recursively creating images from the quadtree. 
The second part involved writing functions to encode images and messages into an image using LSB steganography, and writing functions to decode them too.
